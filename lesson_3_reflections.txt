When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  I would use it when I work with other people, because is useful and faster the develop of the project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because some branches I might keep it in private.
