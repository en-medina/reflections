When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  I would use it when I work with other people, because is useful and faster the develop of the project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because some branches I might keep it in private.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Branches are used to make different modifications to the same project without modified the master line's history.

	Clone are used to copy all the files and the history of another project, to another localization.

	forks used to clone someone else project to your github account directly.

	I{d use branch to divide my project in different version, or when I work with someone else. Instead, I'd use clone when I want to modify only in my local pc a project. But If I want to clone and post in github someone else project, I'd fork it.
